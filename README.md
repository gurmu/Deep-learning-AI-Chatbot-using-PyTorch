# Deep-learning-AI-Chatbot-using-PyTorch


Building a closed-domain chatbot is simple but developing a contextual sensing chatbot requires Neural network layer which will store state or learnable weights. To build a high-performance chatbot, the researchers worked on scaling neural models in the number of parameters as well as the size of the data they are trained on. In this lesson, we are going to create a chatbot framework and build a conversational model for an apartment Leasing office using pytorch. The chatbot for this business needs to handle simple questions about available rooms, amenities and so on

Lesson Goals
In this lesson, Weâ€™re going to create a chatbot framework and build a conversational model for an apartment Leasing office. The chatbot for this business needs to handle simple questions about available rooms, amenities and so on. We also want it to handle contextual responses such as inquiries about application status. Getting this right could brings more future residence!
